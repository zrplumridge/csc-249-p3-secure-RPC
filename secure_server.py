### Instructions ###
# In order to execute TLS with a client, a server needs to do the
# following once, before accepting incoming connections:
#  * Generate a public/private key pair (done below)
#  * Create a certificate that contains the server's IP address, port, and public key
#    * Fill in format_certificate() below
#  * Verify its identity with the certificate authority (we'll skip this step)
#  * Send the certificate to the certificate authority to be signed
#  * Save the signed certificate to send to incoming clients as part of the TLS handshake

# Format and return a certificate containing the server's socket information and public key
